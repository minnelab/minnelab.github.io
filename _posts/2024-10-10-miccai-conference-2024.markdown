We are excited to announce that our lab is visiting the MICCAI (Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention) conference! This prestigious event brings together researchers from around the world to share the latest advances in medical image computing and computer-assisted intervention.

We were represented by Fabian, Simone, Sanna, and Zhikai, and presented in the CDMRI workshop, DeepBReath, and BraTS.
