# MAIA at AIDA TechDays Workshop
On **17 September 2025**, [**Simone Bendazzoli**](/people/simone) presented [**MAIA**](/maia/) at the **AIDA TechDays Workshop**, hosted by the **AIDA community**, Sweden's leading arena for medical AI research. This workshop showcased **MAIA's capabilities** in facilitating collaborative, reproducible, and scalable AI development in healthcare.

### Workshop Highlights

- [**End-to-End Model Development**](https://minnelab.github.io/MAIA-AIDA-TechDays-Workshop/#/9): Demonstrated the workflow from DICOM data ingestion to model deployment using **nnU-Net** within the MAIA platform.

- [**Active Learning Integration**](https://minnelab.github.io/MAIA-AIDA-TechDays-Workshop/#/47): Showcased how **MONAI Label** and **3D Slicer** can be utilized for active learning cycles, enhancing model performance with minimal labeled data.

- [**Federated Learning Implementation**](https://minnelab.github.io/MAIA-AIDA-TechDays-Workshop/#/52): Explained the setup of **NVFlare** within MAIA for federated learning, enabling collaborative model training across institutions without sharing sensitive data.
