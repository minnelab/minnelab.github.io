<p>This year, some members of <strong>MINNELab</strong> had the pleasure of attending <strong>MICCAI 2025</strong> in <strong>Daejeon, South Korea</strong> â€” an incredible experience to reconnect with the vibrant and inspiring <strong>MICCAI community</strong>. The conference provided a fantastic opportunity for discussions, collaborations, and the exchange of ideas across medical imaging and AI.</p>

<p><a href="/people/simone"><strong>Simone Bendazzoli</strong></a> presented at two workshops:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>BraTS Workshop</strong> â€” <em>BraTS-FL: Enhancing Generalization in Brain Tumor Segmentation via Federated Learning</em>
This work introduced a federated learning approach to improve <strong>generalization across brain tumor subtypes</strong>, including adult glioma, metastasis, meningioma, pediatric glioma, and sub-Saharan African cohorts. The paper will appear soon in the workshop proceedings.<br />
The method was also <strong>awarded first prize</strong> in the <strong>BraTS GoaT Task 7 subchallenge</strong> on generalizability across tumor types â€” a rewarding recognition for the effort toward creating more robust and inclusive AI models in neuroimaging.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>DeCaF (Distributed and Collaborative Federated Learning) 2025 Workshop</strong> â€” <em>MONet-FL: Extending nnU-Net with MONAI for Clinical Federated Learning</em><br />
Simone presented the <strong>MONet Bundle</strong>, an open-source framework that integrates <strong>nnU-Net</strong> into the <strong>MONAI ecosystem</strong>, enabling its use in <strong>federated learning, active learning</strong>, and <strong>PACS integration</strong>.<br />
The MONet Bundle was showcased in two federated tasks: <strong>whole-body PET-CT lymphoma segmentation</strong> and <strong>multimodal MRI brain tumor segmentation</strong>.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-032-05663-4_10">Paper (Springer Link)</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/minnelab/MONet-Bundle">Code (GitHub)</a></li>
      <li>A dedicated post about the <strong>MONet Bundle</strong> will be available soon.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Beyond the scientific exchange, the team deeply appreciated the <strong>warm hospitality and rich culture of Korea</strong>, from the food and traditions to the welcoming atmosphere throughout Daejeon.</p>

<p>We return from MICCAI 2025 energized and inspired â€” looking forward to <strong>reconnecting with the MICCAI community</strong> soon for more exciting discussions, collaborations, and innovations in medical imaging AI.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/miccai-2025/MICCAI.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/miccai-2025/MICCAI.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Study trip to LA organized by WASP</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2025/10/04/WASP-LA-trip.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Study trip to LA organized by WASP" /><published>2025-10-04T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2025-10-04T00:00:00+02:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2025/10/04/WASP-LA-trip</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2025/10/04/WASP-LA-trip.html"><![CDATA[<p>Our group was represented by <a href="/people/sanna">Sanna Persson</a> as WASP affilited at an exciting study trip to Los Angeles organized by WASP (Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program).

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) subjects usually show more profound morphological changes with time compared to cognitively normal (CN) individuals. These changes are the combination of two major biological processes: normal aging and AD pathology. Investigating normal aging and residual morphological changes separately can increase our understanding of the disease. This paper proposes two scores, the aging score (AS) and the AD-specific score (ADS), whose purpose is to measure these two components of brain atrophy independently. For this, in the first step, we estimate the atrophy due to the normal aging of CN subjects by computing the expected deformation required to match imaging templates generated at different ages. We used a state-of-the-art generative deep learning model for generating such imaging templates. In the second step, we apply deep learning-based diffeomorphic registration to align the given image of a subject with a reference imaging template. Parametrization of this deformation field is then decomposed voxel-wise into their parallel and perpendicular components with respect to the parametrization of the expected atrophy of CN individuals in one year computed in the first step. AS and ADS are the normalized scores of these two components, respectively. We evaluated these two scores on the OASIS-3 dataset with 1,014 T1-weighted MRI scans. Of these, 326 scans were from CN subjects, and 688 scans were from subjects diagnosed with AD at various stages of clinical severity, as defined by clinical dementia rating (CDR) scores. Our results reveal that AD is marked by both disease-specific brain changes and an accelerated aging process. Such changes affect brain regions differently. Moreover, the proposed scores were sensitive to detect changes in the early stages of the disease, which is promising for its potential future use in clinical studies.

<p>Introduction: In tractography, redundancy poses a significant challenge, often resulting in tractograms that include anatomically implausible streamlines or those that fail to represent the brainâ€™s white matter architecture accurately. Current filtering methods aim to refine tractograms by addressing these issues, but they lack a unified measure of redundancy and can be computationally demanding.</p>

<p>Methods: We propose a novel framework to quantify tractogram redundancy based on filtering tractogram subsets without endorsing a specific filtering algorithm. Our approach defines redundancy based on the anatomical plausibility and diffusion signal representation of streamlines, establishing both lower and upper bounds for the number of false-positive streamlines and the tractogram redundancy.</p>

<p>Results: We applied this framework to tractograms from the Human Connectome Project, using geometrical plausibility and statistical methods informed by the streamlined attributes and ensemble consensus. Our results establish bounds for the tractogram redundancy and the false-discovery rate of the tractograms.</p>

<p>Conclusion: This study advances the understanding of tractogram redundancy and supports the refinement of tractography methods. Future research will focus on further validating the proposed framework and exploring tractogram compression possibilities.</p>]]></content><author><name>Sanna Persson &amp; Rodrigo Moreno</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Published in Frontiers in Neuroscience]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/papers/bounding_tractography.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/papers/bounding_tractography.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry></feed>
