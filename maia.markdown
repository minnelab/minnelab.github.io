## MAIA: Bridging the Gap Between Medical AI Research and Clinical Adoption

**MAIA** is a medical AI platform developed within **MINNELab** by **Simone Bendazzoli**. It was designed to address a critical challenge in medical AI: bridging the gap between research innovation and clinical adoption.

In medical AI, isolating individual stages of the development process often **obstructs the advancement of impactful research**. Fragmented workflows limit the potential for iterative improvement, validation, and — critically — **translation into clinically usable solutions**.

For example, a lung nodule detection model developed in isolation, without collaboration with radiologists or IT and infrastructure planning, might perform well in a lab setting but fail to integrate with hospital systems like PACS. Without clinical input and a continuous feedback loop, even promising AI models may remain unusable, rendering the research effort ineffective.

To overcome these challenges, there is a growing need for a **shared, open, and collaborative environment**. Such a platform allows knowledge, models, and algorithms to be freely exchanged between research groups and institutions, promoting iterative evaluation and collective advancement.

### Introducing MAIA

With this vision, **MAIA** was developed as a **medical AI platform** built to:

- Promote collaboration across diverse areas of expertise  
- Integrate all stages of the AI lifecycle within a **unified environment**  
- Allow **open sharing of models and algorithms** between researchers  
- Facilitate **clinical validation** through direct integration with hospital infrastructures

### Key Features

MAIA supports the **complete AI lifecycle**, incorporating:

- **Active learning** with human-in-the-loop refinement  
- Integration of deep learning models with **PACS** for automatic segmentation of incoming DICOM images  
- **Federated learning** across institutions, enabling collaborative model improvement without sharing patient data  

By connecting researchers, clinicians, and infrastructure in a single platform, MAIA bridges the critical gap between **medical AI research and clinical adoption**, accelerating the translation of innovative models into solutions that truly impact patient care.

### Current and Future Directions

We are exploring the integration of **large language models (LLMs)** into radiology workflows to enable **automatic report generation** directly from medical images and corresponding segmentation masks as **ROIs**.  

This will allow a seamless pipeline from image acquisition, AI-based analysis, segmentation, and finally to structured clinical reporting — helping to further accelerate clinical adoption of AI.  

We welcome collaborations — if you are interested in contributing or exploring these capabilities, **feel free to reach out**!
