## About me

I'm a Ph.D. student in the division of Biomedical Imaging with affiliation to the WASP-AI program. My research's primary interest is the development and investigation of novel Machine-Learning techniques in biomedical image processing. Specifically, I want to exploit geometrical properties and symmetries of the given image-signals to tackle data-sparsity problems with domain-specific model-design (e.g., Geometrical Deep learning, Graph-CNN, Topology).
