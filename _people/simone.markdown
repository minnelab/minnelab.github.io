## About me

I began my PhD in October 2020, focusing on medical image processing using deep learning — a field that has rapidly evolved but still faces challenges in real-world clinical adoption. Over the years, working at the intersection of AI research and medical practice has made me reflect deeply on how difficult it remains to integrate the models we develop into clinical workflows in a transparent, reproducible, and scalable way.

This realization led me to design and build MAIA, an open-source Medical AI platform that promotes collaboration and reproducibility in medical imaging research. MAIA integrates Kubernetes, MONAI, and the MONAI Bundle format to simplify deploying, configuring, and updating AI models in distributed research environments. It integrates essential tools such as 3D Slicer, OHIF Viewer, Orthanc, XNAT, and MLFlow, forming a cohesive ecosystem for annotation, model training, active learning, and refinement.

Through this work, I aim to bridge the gap between AI innovation and clinical implementation by providing researchers and clinicians with the infrastructure they need to collaborate effectively.

As I approach the defense of my PhD thesis on November 27, 2025, my focus remains on advancing open, modular, and transparent medical AI systems that can empower the community and accelerate the safe translation of research into practice.

When I’m not coding or experimenting with new infrastructure designs, I’m usually out running — my favorite way to clear my mind, stay focused, and find inspiration for the next challenge.
