## About me
My research focuses on improving the early detection and diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases by leveraging tractography, a non-invasive technique used to visually represent neural tracts. This technique is instrumental in understanding the complex network of connections in the brain, particularly the changes in structural brain connectivity at different disease stages. We aim to address this gap to allow for more precise connectivity analysis and possible clinical applications. During my PhD I'm interested in delving deep into the following topics: 


- Improving existing methods for tractography filtering with graph neural networks

- Using generative models for diffusion MRI and magnetic resonance elastography with downstream applications in tractography

- Brain connectivity analysis leveraging deep learning methods

- Incorporating XAI in predictive modeling for neuro-degenerative diseases
